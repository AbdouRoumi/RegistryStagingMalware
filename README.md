# Registry Staging and Shellcode Injection


This project demonstrates how to read and write registry values and perform process injection using shellcode. It provides two key functionalities: 
1. Reading from and writing to the Windows Registry.
2. Injecting shellcode into a remote process.

## Features
- **Read from Registry**: Retrieves binary data stored in the registry.
- **Write to Registry**: Writes binary data (shellcode) into the registry.
- **Shellcode Injection**: Injects shellcode into a remote process for execution.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **`ReadStageWare.cpp`**: Main file containing the functions to interact with the registry and inject shellcode.
  - `readRegistryValue()`: Reads a specific registry value and prints the binary data in hex format.
  - `writeRegistryValue()`: Writes a hardcoded shellcode binary to a registry key.
  - `RemoteProcessInjector()`: Injects shellcode into a process.
  
## Prerequisites
- **Windows OS**: This project is designed to run on Windows systems, as it interacts with the Windows Registry and uses Windows APIs.
- **Visual Studio**: Used for building and compiling the project.
- **Administrator Privileges**: Required for modifying the registry and injecting into processes.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RegistryStaging.git
cd RegistryStaging
```

### Build the Project
1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Build the project by clicking **Build > Build Solution**.

### Running the Application

#### 1. Reading from the Registry
The application reads from the following registry key:
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\R0m4Key
```
To read the data, call:
```cpp
readRegistryValue();
```

#### 2. Writing Shellcode to the Registry
To write shellcode data into the registry, call:
```cpp
writeRegistryValue();
```
This function writes hardcoded binary shellcode to the `R0m4Key` registry value.

#### 3. Shellcode Injection
To inject shellcode into a remote process, use:
```cpp
RemoteProcessInjector(shellcode, ...);
```
This function will inject the specified shellcode into a target process.

### Error Handling
The code provides detailed error messages via the `GetLastError()` Windows API call if there are issues with registry access or process injection. Be sure to check the console output for error codes.

## Usage Example
```cpp
int main() {
    // Read registry value
    readRegistryValue();
    
    // Write shellcode to registry
    writeRegistryValue();
    
    // Inject shellcode into remote process
    unsigned char shellcode[] = { /* your shellcode here */ };
    RemoteProcessInjector(shellcode, ...);
    
    return 0;
}
```
